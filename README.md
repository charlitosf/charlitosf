👋 Hi, I’m Carlos Ferrús! I am graduated in Computer Science and hold a Master's Degree in Cybersecurity by the [University of Alicante](https://www.ua.es/en/index.html).

👀 I’m interested in all sorts of topics and projects related to almost every single aspect of computer science: web development, data science, systems administration, cryptography, etc. I also love learning new things and I am open to learning anything new that catches my eye.

🌱 I’m currently learning [RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation), although I'm always busy reading articles and watching videos about new technologies, frameworks, tools...

💞️ I’m quite new at open-source collaboration. Therefore, I'm looking to collaborate on simple projects that use technologies that I understand. Then, I'd like to move on to more complex challenges.

📫 My email is `carlos@ferrus.es` and I'll be happy to tell you more about my interests and read about collaboration requests or any interesting stuff!
